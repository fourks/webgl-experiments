Things Iâ€™d like to try:

* ~~Add a performance monitor to display ms/frame rendering times~~
* Optimisation, based on the tips from the Google IO WebGL optimisation video
* Multiple light sources, directional and positional
* Loading and rendering complex models imported from 3D software
* Post-processing effects using shaders
* Applying multiple shaders simultaneously, also applying shaders to specific objects
* Blending and alpha transparency
* Try out various scene graph implementations
* Rendering an isometric world with Syndicate Wars style camera control
* UV mapping, creating more realism with textures
* Light mapping, improving performance by baking lights rather than purely dynamic
* Using normal maps (and other non-obvious uses for baking data into textures)
* Animation and picking - increasing interactivity
* Rendering shadows
* Particle effects / effects using noise (e.g. dynamic terrain, etc)
