Things Iâ€™d like to try:

* ~~Add a performance monitor to display ms/frame rendering times~~
* ~~Loading and rendering models imported from 3D software~~
* ~~UV mapping, creating more realism with textures~~
* ~~Writing a robust FBX>>JSON exporter on top of the Autodesk FBX SDK~~
* Imported 3D models with animations
* Multiple light sources + visualising the light sources
* Blending and alpha transparency
* Applying multiple shaders simultaneously, also applying shaders to specific objects
* Rendering multiple views/cameras of the same scene simultaneously (as in the Google IO demo)
* Light mapping, improving performance by baking lights rather than purely dynamic
* Normal mapping
* Rendering shadows
* Parallax mapping
* Post-processing effects using shaders
* Interactivity / picking
* Particle effects / effects using noise (e.g. dynamic terrain, etc)
* Optimisation, based on the tips from the Google IO WebGL optimisation video
* Try out various scene graph implementations
* Investigate various WebGL JavaScript frameworks (e.g. three.js, tdl, SpiderGL, etc)
* Integrate JSLint into an automated build process
* Rendering an isometric world with Syndicate Wars style camera control
